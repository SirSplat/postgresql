# PostgreSQL DBO Docker Image

This is a simple container built from PostgreSQL 17-alpine and a dbo role (not a superuser) created.

# **These must not be confused with any official PostgreSQL images provided by PostgreSQL**
I have used PostgreSQL because it is my RDBMS of choice! That and it's "The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database", go take a gander at [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you want to see for yourself. :)

# Why yet another PostgreSQL Docker image?
Well, because I wanted standardized images that do not use a superuser (postgres by default), for executing application database migrations that I could use for all my other projects.

So use it or don't! In any event, have fun, be safe and ofc "Do not run sh%& as root! :)"

# How to use this image
```bash
docker run --name some-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword sirsplat/postgresql -d postgres
```

Now you'll have a running container named some-name, accessable via CMD

```bash
docker exec -it some-name psql -U dbo -h localhost -p 5432 -d postgres
```
